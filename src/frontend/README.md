The UI supports three primary user actions:

    View Signals: Upon loading, the UI automatically fetches and displays the list of all currently configured signals.

    Add Signal: A user can fill out the "Add Signal" form with a valid VSS path, select a data type from a dropdown, and specify frequency and parameters, then submit it to add the signal to the simulation.

    Remove Signal: A user can click the "Remove" button next to any signal in the list to immediately stop its simulation and remove it from the configuration.
